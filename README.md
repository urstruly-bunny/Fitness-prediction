# Fitness Weight Prediction

## Project Overview
We aim to predict the weight of individuals after 2 months based on their current fitness metrics. The goal is to provide tailored fitness and dietary recommendations.

### BMI Calculation
The primary fitness measurement index used in this project is the **Body Mass Index (BMI)**:
\[ BMI = \frac{WEIGHT}{HEIGHT^2} \]
*(Weight in kg and Height in meters)*

### Data Collection & Assumptions
- The dataset consists of weight records collected from college students 2 months ago.
- Throughout the model and prediction process, we assume that the individuals have maintained a **constant calorie intake** with no significant changes in diet or food consumption.

### Additional Project Details
- A PowerPoint presentation (`PROJECT PRESENTATION.ppt`) is attached, providing detailed insights into **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning algorithms used, and other related information**.

## Usage
To use this model:
1. Download the repository.
